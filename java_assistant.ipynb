Here's a basic definition and distinction between the two:\\n\\n**For Loop:**\\nA `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. The structure of a `for` loop includes the initialization of the loop control variable, the loop condition (which is checked before each iteration), and the increment or decrement of the loop control variable. It is often used when you want to iterate over an array or a range of values.\\n\\nHere's the syntax of a for loop in Java:\\n```java\\nfor (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {\\n    // block of code to be executed\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor example, if you want to iterate over a range of integers from 0 to 9, you might write:\\n```java\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\\n    System.out.println(i);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**While Loop:**\\nA `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition. The loop executes as long as the condition is `true`. The loop condition is checked before each iteration, but unlike a `for` loop, the initialization and increment/decrement happen inside the loop body or before the loop starts.\\n\\nHere's the syntax of a while loop in Java:\\n```java\\nwhile (condition) {\\n    // block of code to be executed\\n    // increment/decrement\\n}\\n```\\n\\nFor example, if you want to iterate until a certain condition is met, like finding the first multiple of 5 greater than 20:\\n```java\\nint i = 0;\\nwhile (i <= 20) {\\n    i++;\\n    if (i % 5 == 0) {\\n        System.out.println(\\\"First multiple of 5 greater than 20 is: \\\" + i);\\n        break;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Key Differences:**\\n1. Initialization, condition check, and increment/decrement are included in the same line in a `for` loop, whereas in a `while` loop, these parts can be scattered.\\n2. Generally, `for` loops are used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop, and `while` loops are used when the iterations depend on a condition that is evaluated during the execution.\\n3. A `for` loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure, while a `while` loop can be more expressive and flexible, especially in scenarios where the control variable might be altered by different parts of the code within the loop body.\"\n",
